** 
** there is no assoc file with buffer. how can i tell emacs that?
** use ezimage to add GUI image icons
   (require 'ezimage)
   easy-customize, speedbar all use it to display image.

   text <-> gui element
   --------------------
   <+> dir icon (use a nice 3D looking dir icon)
   <f> music icon (use a 3D looking 音符 icon)

*** do this when almost done.
** how to display the text in another form
   for example <+> displayed as an icon
   lambda displayed as the lambda letter

   see
   g: Special Properties
   g: Overlays Properties
** use midentify to get tag information, so smp will only depend on mplayer
** code reading on emms and EmacsAlsaPlayer
   info doc of emms, done.
   EAP has much better document. nearly the same as what I suppose to implement
   in smp.

** choose a music player backend
   mplayer
   AlsaPlayer
   mpd - music player daemon
   
** I remember mplayer project said it's not a music player. it's a movie player.
   see what music player they recommand and why.
** how to support more than one sound card?
   EAP has this feature
** how to control mplayer in emacs
   volume
   previous/next

   fifo, named pipe

   3.3.3. Slave mode
   The slave mode allows you to build simple frontends to MPlayer. When run with
   the -slave option MPlayer will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from
   stdin. The commands are documented in the slave.txt file.
   

** how to reuse existing mplayer process.
   one instance is enough for all.
   don't exit when done playing a song. only exit when emacs exit.

   use my lisp playlist and send song to mplayer, instead of mplayer -playlist
   option.
** major mode in info doc
   
*** eldoc Lists mode print list name in echo area
   
*** (put 'funny-mode 'mode-class 'special)

** keymap
   `(t . BINDING)'
   print (message "not a command: %?" key) for keys that are not binded.

** Desktop Save Mode
   ref: elisp info g: Desktop Save Mode

   For buffers not visiting a file to have their state saved, the major
   mode must bind the buffer local variable `desktop-save-buffer' to a
   non-`nil' value.


** find a good name for this library.
   name it dog
   M-x dog

   easy to type. not cute, but simple to remember.
** rename this lib before releasing.
** about m3u format
   The file is saved with the "M3U" or "m3u" filename extension, and - if
   edited in a text editor - must be encoded in the ANSI (Windows-1252) format
   in order to be understood by media players.

** mplayer slave mode
