smp.el -- simple music player

* write a music player for emacs 				 :emacs:easy:
  EMMS is just not nice.
** the list buffer looks like this
   icons for dir looks like that in speedbar. (clickable and foldable)
   <+> ~/musics/foo
      [music icon] foo1.mp3
      [music icon] foo2.mp3
   <+> /fat32/down/musics/bar
      [music icon] bar1.mp3
      [music icon] bar2.mp3
      [music icon] bar3.mp3

** the Lists buffer is for managing mplayer portable play lists
   it looks like this:
   current playing list have a different bg face on every file, light green
   <+> default-list [playing]                                         [loop]
      <+> ~/musics/foo
         [music icon] foo1.mp3
         [music icon] foo2.mp3
      <+> /fat32/down/musics/bar
         [music icon] bar1.mp3
         [music icon] bar2.mp3
         [music icon] bar3.mp3
   <+> mylist1                                               [loop] [random]
      <+> ~/musics/foobar
         [music icon] foobar1.mp3
         [music icon] foobar2.mp3
      <+> /fat32/down/musics/foo
         [music icon] foo.mp3
*** Lists buffer bindings
    SPC  pause playing (for active list)
    q    hide Lists
    c    jump to current list

    some keys have different behavior from list buffer
    g    works for list at point
    l
    o
    j/k  works on boundaries when moving (require different function)
    n    works marked files across lists
    
    when point is at list heading line. (eg. default-list, mylist1)
    D    delete list from disk (ask for confirmation)
    p    play this list
    RET  play this list
    e    edit the list file (plain editing)
         the user can do insert, ordering, query-replace, anything.

** list buffer bindings
   a    add file or dir
        parameter can be:
	~/musics/*.mp3
	~/musics/foo/    add music all files under this dir
   d    delete file from list
   D    delete file from disk, ask do you want to delete all ref in play lists
   r    rename file from list (so, each file can have a show name.)
   R    rename/mv file (disk)
   RET  play this file
   SPC  pause, thus mute
   q    hide list
   m    mark
   u    unmark
   n    make new list from marked file
   L    goto Lists buffer
   s    select file to move; deselect if the file is being selected.
   j    previous line; if there is a selected file, move that file down
   k    next line;     if there is a selected file, move that file up
   l    toggle loop list (remember the choice for every list) on by default
   o    toggle random (remember the choice for every list) off by default
        r is already used, so o for randOm.
   T    toggle show Tags, show filename or mp3 tags (remember the choice for every list)
   g    refresh list (update dir 'file' and pattern 'file')
   
** speedbar bindings   
   a    add file to current list (current list is currently playing list)

** global bindings
   C-c e n    next file
   C-c e p    previous file
   C-c e r    repeat this file (play this file again and again, don't go next)
              use C-c e n to go to next file.
   C-c e e    show list
   C-c e SPC  pause

** implementations
*** show command message for every command, such as
    "loop list: on"
    "random: on"
*** when add file to list
    auto insert the new file at the end of the existing dir (if any)
    or create a new dir item and put it there
*** playlist file format
    patterns and dir are dynamic file in list, they will be expanded each time
    the list is read from disk. for example,
    
    adding ~/musics/*.mp3 to a list will scan all mp3 files in ~/musics each
    time it gets read from disk or refresh by the user.
    
**** playlist must store
     loop, random info
     files in order
     file name in list (alias in list)

**** playlist must be playable by mplayer using -playlist option.
     check what does mplayer accept.
     does it accept only dir name in the list?

**** one probable format
     #loop
     #random
     ##        //marks the end of meta info
     #display name
     /path/to/music/file
